## Overview

The WorldQuiz app is designed to be an engaging way to learn about the world. The main idea is that the player clicks a button to spin a wheel. After the wheel stops, the player's character will travel to the location indicated by the wheel. A trivia question related to that location will then be presented. Answer correctly to gain points and learn something new!

## Features

- **Interactive Spinning Wheel:** Spin the wheel to randomly select a location.
- **Character Movement:** Watch as your character travels to the selected location.
- **Location-Based Questions:** Once at the location, you'll be asked a trivia question about that place.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Each spin gives a new experience with different locations and questions.
  
## Technologies

- **HTML5**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **CSS**

## How to Play

1. Click the "Spin" button to spin the wheel.
2. Once the wheel stops, your character will move to the location that appears.
